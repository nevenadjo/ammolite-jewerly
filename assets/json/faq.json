      "question": "How do I use my polishing cloth?",

      "question": "How do I determine ring size?",
      "answer": "While we can never be certain of your size without having physically measured your finger or trying on one of our rings in store, we do have a few handy tricks that may help you determine either your ring sizer or the ring size of a loved one! If you already have a ring with the perfect fit, whether it was gifted or an heirloom piece, grab a ruler and measure the internal diameter."
